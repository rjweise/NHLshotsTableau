Load the data with the shot locations into Tableau
- Create a calculated field called XCoord% to convert the X value to a percentage along the length of the ice, with: ([X]+100)/2

- Create a calculated field called XCalcImg% to convert the CoordX% value to projected value to match the 3D image, with: 
(0.0001*([Coord%]^3)) + (-0.025*([Coord%]^2)) + (2.5*([Coord%])) + 0

- Create a calculated field called Ycalc to scale the Y value to the image, with: 
(-0.72*[CalcImg%] + 105)/100 * [Y]
